Superscalar Tomasulo out-of-order execution CPU(two in-order issue, out-of-order execution, four in-order commits). Pipelined, PLRU, 4-way, Write-Back, Write-Allocate, I-Cache & D-Cache connect with single port Banked Burst Dram. Implement GShare bimodal and Perceptron Branch Prediction together with BTB Jump Table. Memory disambiguation with store_queue&store_buffer -> load_res forwarding, post-commit store buffer. Implement modified Dadda multiplier(10 cycles) and Synopsys DW_div_seq IP(16 cycles) to support full RV32-M Extension. Now could achieve 440 MHz(freq), 197753Î¼m2(area), 0.67 IPC, 36mW(power) on average testing on mergesort, rsa encryption, fft, etc testcode.
